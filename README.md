# C++ Option Pricing Library

This project is a C++ implementation of classical option pricing models used in quantitative finance.
It was developed as part of an academic project simulating professional financial engineering practices.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a reusable and robust pricing library for financial derivatives.
The implementation follows an object-oriented approach and focuses on correctness, extensibility,
and consistency with theoretical models.

## Objectives

- Implement option pricing models used in finance
- Apply object-oriented design principles in C++
- Price different types of options under various models
- Compare numerical methods with closed-form solutions
- Ensure clean, modular, and testable code

## Implemented Models and Features

- Black–Scholes closed-form pricing
- Cox–Ross–Rubinstein (binomial tree) model
- Monte Carlo pricing under Black–Scholes dynamics
- European, American, Digital, and Asian options
- Greeks computation (Delta)
- Early exercise policy for American options

## Academic Context

This project was developed for a **C++ for Finance** course and adheres to the specifications
provided in the assignment. The final submission requires a clean source-only version
(`.cpp` and `.h` files).
